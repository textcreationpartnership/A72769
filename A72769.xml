            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:150504:6"/> as in his holy Temple: whoe will not (as holy Scripture telleth) enter into the ſoule of the wicked, nor be harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">1.

It behooueth therefore to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the prophets councell, to ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thy ſelfe from ſin, and ſo ſhalt thou become a fit inſtrument to doo good.</p>
            <p>The which ſequeſtration from ſin, <note place="margin">Pſa. 33. Pſa. 33. Iſai. 1. 1. Pet. 3.</note> and purging of the ſoule, is procured by true and hartie repentance for thy ſinnes paſt. In aſmuch as it is certaine, that there is no man, nor no man can be without ſin, and ſin is the very poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and bane of mans ſoule, and that which the Prophet ſaith is true, your wickedneſſe hath made a diuiſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you and your God, and your <note place="margin">Eſai. 59. 2.</note> ſinnes haue hidden his face from you, that he ſhould not heare you. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſinne dooth not onelie make diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betweene God and man, which in deed is the moſt lamentable diuiſion that man can thinke on, for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the prophet. Thy malice ſhall rebuke thee, and thy turning away ſhal <note place="margin">Ier. 2. 19.</note>

But it alſo maketh a great diſſention in thine owne ſelfe: for the Prophet crieth out, <hi>Peccatum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>

               <hi>contrame eſt ſemper:</hi> My ſinne is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes againſt me. A lamentable thing it is, to ſee a kingdome diuided in it ſelf, for it ſhall be deſolate, and the houſe or <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 25</note> Citie that is not at vnitie in it ſelfe, ſhal not ſtand. Diſquietneſſe of conſcience, ſtrife betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, and the diſſention in the verie will of man, deſcribed by the Apoſtle is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, nay rather cauſed by ſinne. And I referre my ſelfe vnto them that are <note place="margin">Rom. 7, 19 19. &amp;c.</note> vexed with the diſquietneſſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether there bee a greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then it in the worlde, for euerie battell that a man hath without, may be preuented by ſome policie, or illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome ſtratagem, and therefore not ſo dangerous, but when a man fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and carieth his owne enemie in
<pb facs="tcp:150504:7"/> his owne boſome, the matter is more daungerous, and the deſtruction of a man more eminent. And ſo (I ſaie) it is alſo a lamentable caſe to ſee a man diuided in himſelfe. But if that bee ſo lamentable that the Prophet cryeth out, who wil giue water vnto my head, <note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r. 9. 1, 2. 3. &amp;c.</note> and a fountaine of teares vnto myne eies? &amp;c. no doubt that diuiſion is to be deplored, and bewailed with a ſea of tears, which is between God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for as God is vnity it ſelfe, &amp; the cauſe of al vnion, that is amongſt his creatures: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the debate and conciſion that is betweene God and man, is the cauſe of all other debats that are in the vniform multiformitie of the world. Therefore we reade, and ſometimes do ſee things go againſt their nature, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinnes, as the earth couered with water in the time of Noah was <note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> the puniſhment of the old world, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> fier deſcended from heauen, for the puniſhment of the Sodomits: and ſuch like puniſhments in the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. In the newe Teſtament though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150504:7"/> Gods mercie bee more reuealed, and though there bee not ſo greate ſignes of his iuſtice ſhewed, yet did the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures deteſt ſinne, and declared it by darkneſſe in the daie time againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the obſcuration of the ſunne, the <note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> renting of ſtones in ſunder, and of the vaile of the temple, the opening of the graues, &amp;c. generallie let this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſtand, there is nothing ſo much againſt nature, as is ſinne, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things (in a manner) to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte their natures, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Seeing then that ſinne is ſo daungerous, that it doth not onely ſet diuiſion between man in himſelfe, but alſo betweene God and man: let a man therefore auoide it, in aſmuch as hee can, otherwiſe hee runneth day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie further and further to his owne vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine and deſtruction. Two things therefore doth the Prophet propound vnto a man that intendeth to leade a newe life, and to turne vnto the Lorde, the firſte is <hi>Declina à malo,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe euill. The which thing howe
<pb facs="tcp:150504:8"/> naturall it is for a man to follow it, is declared in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures. And God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the malice of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the earth, was verie great, and that the thoughts of his heart was alwayes bent to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: hee repented that he had made man vpon the earth. Beſides that, the <note place="margin">Gen. 6, 5.</note> multitude of the wicked in this world, dooth ſufficiently manifeſt the ſame, for you ſhall hardly finde a man that hath taken a ſmacke in ſinne, to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forſake the ſame, without God of his ſpeciall grace doe reueale to him the danger that he is in. And a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo miſerable a caſe, goeth on ſtill neuer looking into the lewd life which he hath led. It is requiſite therfore that a man doe call vnto God for grace, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the purifying of his ſoule, for of our ſelues wee are neither able to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew euill, nor to doe good, but both the one and the other is the gifte of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, who dooth woorke in vs, <hi>&amp; velle, &amp; perficere,</hi> both to will <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> and to perfourme, and that alſo of his good will and pleaſure. Conſidering
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150504:8"/> then firſt, the frailtie of man in falling ſo often, his impotencie in not ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, his negligence in ſeeking of help, his ingratitude in refuſing the helpe that is offered vnto him, his ſlouthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in vſing Gods grace beſtowed vpon him: who would not thinke that of all the creatures that God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, man is the moſt negligent in ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his whole life, and all his actions vnto the ende, vnto the which hee is created? But true it is that Moiſes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Song, in expoſtulation with the children of Iſrael for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, <hi>Deum quite genuit, de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquisti, &amp; oblatus es Domini creato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris tui.</hi> Thou haſt forſaken God who <note place="margin">Deut. 32, 18.</note> hath begotten thee, and haſt forſaken the Lord thy creator. But to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall euent, which is, to direct him whoſe minde is bent to ſerue God, and to forſake his euill life paſt, I will take this for a generall principle, hee that committeth ſinne, is of the Diuell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">1. Io. 3. 8</note> the Diuell ſinneth from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, if all that commit ſin be of the
<pb facs="tcp:150504:9"/> Diuell, and all of vs offende in manie things, how many men ſhall we find to be free from ſinne? Wee may ſay with the Prophet in the 14. Pſalm, There is not one that doth good, no not one, yet euerie man ought to take heede of ſinne, and to eſchew it, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of anie excuſe whatſoeuer it be: for God is pure, and muſt bee looked vpon with a pure eye: for it is written: <note place="margin">Math. 5. 8.</note> Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God. Now the ſight of God is nothing els but the knowledge of god: and the knowledge of God is life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, according to the ſaying of our Sauiour, which ſaith, This is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, that they knowe thee to bee the onelie verie God, and whom thou haſt <note place="margin">Ioh, 17, 3.</note> ſent Ieſus Chriſt: and life euerlaſting is the onlie end, vnto the which man was created, and there is no ſtop or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to this life but ſinne. What man then is ſo vnnaturall vnto himſelfe, but would eſchue this impediment, &amp; hate it, <hi>cane peius &amp; angue,</hi> worſe then a dog and a ſnake. But men inueigled with the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150504:9"/> lewdnes of this world, pretend excuſes of this their daliance. Som ſay the knife is dull, and the bread is harde, but the worde of God is more ſharpe then any ſword, of 2. edges whatſoeuer, to pierce the flinty hearts of ſuch obſtinate wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whoſe ende is deſtruction. To thoſe therefore which are in a maner alreadie diſpoſed to repentaunce (of the which as before, I ſayd this, <hi>Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na à malo,</hi> auoyd euill, is the firſt part) I would propound theſe few points for their conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt the enormity of ſin, in the which there is nothing but all kinde of things that ſhould terrefie a man: for before that man by ſuggeſtion of the Serpent tranſgreſſed the commaundement of God, what death, nay what dreame of death had man, being created immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall? <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> Nowe death the laſt enemie that ſhall bee deſtroyed, is moſt irrigular and enormous, and moſt aduerſant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> the life of man. Death commeth by ſinne, for by a man came ſinne, and by
<pb facs="tcp:150504:10"/> ſin came death into the worlde. There is no worldling that is not afrayed of death. But it is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der that the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are not afraid of that thing which cauſeth death? Perſwaded I am, that if a mans eye were ſo ſpirituall to ſee things corporall, a man would abhorre the ſight of any ſinne, were it neuer ſo ſmall. A man that hath a care of neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and cleanlineſſe in apparaile, can not abide the leaſt moat in the world, or the leaſt ſpot that may be imagined in any part of his apparell, and all this is becauſe he would not offend the eyes of men. But a man that is little leſſe in degree then the Angels, and made for <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.</note> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe of his creator, who regardeth not the bodie, but maketh an account of the ſoule: hath no regard of the dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his ſoule, but onely followeth the luſtfull delights of the fleſh. If then men bee ſo diligent in bruſhing, and cleanſing of their garments, that they ſhould not offende the eyes of carnall men, doth it not behooue thee to take heed that the garments of thy ſoule be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150504:10"/> not defiled, with the moſt filthie ſpots of ſin in the ſight of Almightie God?</p>
            <p>Secondly, let him that loueth his own ſaluation, alwayes diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the frail eſtate of this world. And let him weigh how ſhort all carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are. That man will quickly abhor the way of ſinne, which conſidereth that the pleaſure of the fleſh is verie ſhort, but the paine that is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it to bee eternall. The worlde paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth awaie, and the deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.</note> and all men paſſe awaie by death, and no man is permitted to ſtaie long in this worlde, for what is the worlde but a great deepe and a troubleſome Sea, in the which there are ſo manie monſters of ſinne, as there bee euill deſires in men? O falſe, deceiptfull and impure worlde, which ſo fowlly dooſt deceyue thoſe that truſt in thee, and dooſt drowne thoſe that doe followe thee in the depth of hell. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie are thoſe that contemne thee for Chriſt his ſake? And making a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable diuiſion, doe ſpeedilie depart
<pb facs="tcp:150504:11"/> from thy vanities: whatſoeuer wee ſee in the worlde is vanitie, and euerie lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the worlde is vaine, and ſhall quickly be corrupted. Thinke that you ſhall quicklie die, for nothing doth ſo much withdraw a man from ſinne, as the often and diligent meditation of <note place="margin">Ieſ. Syra.</note> death, for it is ſayd, Remember thy lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end, and thou ſhalt neuer ſinne: the neceſſitie of death beeing thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diligently, dooth terrifie the minde, and keepeth it from ſinne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the meditation or thinking vpon the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in the which al men muſt be preſented before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate of Chriſt, helpeth much to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flight of ſin. No man can eſcape this terrible iudgement, but we muſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in it: of the which day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth the Prophet ſay, very great <note place="margin">Ioel. 2.</note> and terrible is the day of the Lord, and who can abide it? And Salomon ſaith, All things that are done vnder the Sun <note place="margin">Prea. 21.</note> wil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord bring to iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp;c. And in Eſai, we reade, The Lord will come to <note place="margin">Eſai. 3.</note> iudgment with the elders &amp; princes of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150504:11"/> his people. And Amos, wo be to them which deſire y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of the Lord, for why <note place="margin">Amos. 5.</note> doe yee wiſh the day of the Lorde, for that day is darkeneſſe and not light? And Sophonie pronouncing the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of that day: ſaieth, the voyce <note place="margin">Soph. 1.</note> of the day of the Lorde is bitter: there ſhall the ſtrong man bee troubled. That day is a day of anger, of trouble and anguiſh, a day of calamitie and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, a day of darkneſſe and blindnes, a day of miſt and whirlewinde, in the fire of the zeale of the Lord, ſhal all the earth bee deuoured, becauſe hee ſhall quickely diſpatch with all the dwellers on the earth. Saint Ambroſe ſaieth, that nothing is more profitable for an honeſt life, than to thinke that he ſhall bee our iudge, which knoweth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of our heartes, and is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with diſhoneſt thinges. For all we, as Saint Paul ſaith, muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the tribunall ſeate of Chriſt, for euerie man ſhall receyue as hee hath doone in his bodie ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or euill. At that terrible
<pb facs="tcp:150504:12"/> houre, the puritie of the heart will bee more worth, then the ſubtill perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rhetoricians: a cleere conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall auaile more than all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the worlde. For hee that ſhall iudge all things cannot bee deceyued, nor by entreatie changed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the conſideration of the bitterneſſe of the eternall paines, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable to the eſchuing of ſinne, for there is not ſo vehement a tentation of carnall pleaſure, but it may bee repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if a man thinke of the puniſhment that the wicked ſuffer in hell. And here leaſt a man ſhould thinke that there is no hell: I will make but this diſcourſe. There is no nation (as <hi>Tullie</hi> ſaith) ſo barbarous, but it hath this ſentence na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turallie written in their harts. <hi>Deos eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</hi> That there are Gods. Nowe that there is a God, by the ſcriptures it is manifeſt. For ſaint Paule ſaith, for the inuiſible thinges of him, that is, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <note place="margin">Rom, 1.</note> power and Godhead, are ſeene by the Creation of the worlde, beeing conſidered in his workes, to the intent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150504:12"/> that they ſhould not be excuſed. And for the ſingularitie of one God, what dooth not Nature tell vs? ſeeing that we ſee all thinges concurre to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of one whole vniuerſity. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe, the greateſt eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of one prouidence of all thinges in the worlde, dooth not onely confeſſe but alſo proue, that there is one onelie <hi>Primus motor,</hi> the firſt moouer, which being granted, we muſt ſay, that there is a God, a Creator, a Conſeruer, a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of all things, and conſequently a prouider for all thinges. For if there be a God, it is requiſite, that in him ſhould be all kind of perfection. So if we count it a perfection in an vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature, to haue a care of the young that is procreated of it: howe much more is it a perfection in almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie God, not onely willingly, and not of necesſitie, to create all things: but alſo to haue a perpetual care of things, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated aſwel viſible as inuiſible, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as vnreaſonable? And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Pſal. 145.</note> ſaith, doth prouide for all thinges

            <p>After this, ſome read part of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture meditating thereon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring God to direct thee, to doe thoſe things, which by his woorde thou art taught to doe, or make a little medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereof I ſhall entreate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,

            <p>And in anie wiſe, beware of one thing, that neither in thine occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or anie other temporall dooings, thou vſe any guile, or exerciſe any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull trade, and againſte conſcience: for ſo ſhould thy building laide vppon <note place="margin">Iam, 5. 1.

            <p>Of ſuch thinges as the Preacher ſhal deliuer in his Sermon, thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to committe ſome ſuch leſſons to memorie, as ſhal moſt concerne thee, and that chiefly hath mooued thee, ſuppoſing our Lord himſelfe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the ſame vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the chiefeſt exerciſes, wherein thou art to ſpend the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon till dinner time, and then behaue thy ſelfe as on other dayes. Hauing then pauſed a little while after dinner, it were a verie fruitefull exerciſe (if thou couldeſt conueniently vſe it) to inſtruct and teach thy familie in the
<pb facs="tcp:150504:24"/> Chriſtian fayth, or learne thy ſelfe if thou vnderſtand it not well, whereby euerie way doth enſue great gaine: for if thou teach others that bee ignorant, thou exerciſeſt one of the ſeuen ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall woorkes of mercie: and if thou <note place="margin">Iam. 5.</note> learne thy ſelfe of others, thou winneſt that which it behooued thee to know: and that is more precious, then moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of worldly wealth.</p>
            <p>After this exerciſe thou maiſt goe and heare Euening prayer, and ſome good leſſon if there be anie, gouerning thy ſelfe in all things, as is aboueſayde in the morning.</p>
            <p>This being done, imploy the ſpare time till night in doing ſome deede of mercy, as in viſiting ſome hoſpitall or priſon, comforting &amp; performing ſom <note place="margin">Iames 1.</note> charitable office to thoſe weake and comfortleſſe Creatures, or otherwiſe thou mayeſt aſſociate thy ſelfe with ſome vertuous companions to report or heare ſome ſpirituall diſcourſes, or reade ſome godlie booke, or finde thee occupied in ſome ſuch like honeſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150504:24"/> exerciſe: and if ſo bee thou thinkeſt it otherwhile expedient to walke abroad for recreation, let it bee in ſome ſecrete and ſolitarie place, where other ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons come not to diſturbe thee, and with their prophane conuerſation withdraw thy mind from God.</p>
            <p>Finally, thou oughteſt euer after dinner on thoſe dayes, to occupie thy ſelfe in ſome ſuch exerciſe, as thy ſoule may thereby reape ſome ſpirituall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and growe more zealous and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in the loue of God, with newe purpoſes and inflamed deſires to goe continually forward, and to waxe ſtronger in his diuine ſeruice, with greater charitie towardes thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, better knowledge of thy ſelfe, and more humilitie in all thy actions.</p>
            <p>Thus is the Sabboth ſanctified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formablie to Gods will, and the intent of the holie Catholique Church. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes, both in thy Meditation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Supper (hauing the meanes to make it) and in the examination of thy conſcience before thou go to bed, thou

Noting this by the way, that on theſe dayes all is to bee done with ſo much more leyſure, feruour, and diligence, as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe of the day dooth require it.</p>
            <p>And here let euerie man that hath children or a familie, learne, that hee is a guide and gouernour to ſuch as bee vnder him, and therefore he is bounde ſo much as in him lyeth, to draw them to the ſeruice of God, cauſing them to heare diuine ſeruice, and to ſpende the holidayes in diuine exerciſes, godly and holie. And in no wiſe are they to allow, that any one in their houſe haue any publique crime, or other notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imperfection: as to be a ſwearer, a <note place="margin">1.

And this is the exerciſe of holy prayer, not onlie verball which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to each one, and more frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all; but alſo heartie prayer, which verie fewe wot of, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie verie fewe doe practiſe, beeing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe the more excellent kinde a great deale. And therefore is it to bee noted, that albeit publike praier, to wit, that which is made with the mouth
<pb facs="tcp:150504:26"/> and voyce, as Common prayer, is a verie profitable thing, inſtituted, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued and practiſed in the Church, yet is not this, but that which wee call praier of the heart, the more worthie and excellent kinde a great deale, and whereof the holy Doctors doe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie meane, when they ſpeake of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of prayer, and the ſingular fruites which proceede thereof. The which ſpirituall kinde of prayer, doth ſo farre paſſe and goe beyonde the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde prayer of the lippes, as doth the ſoule or ſpirite in dignitie paſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the bodie, yet both neceſſarie to be vſed. Wherefore ſuch as minde to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelues throughlie in Gods ſeruice, and to batten and grow ſtrong in ſpirit, ought not to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues onelie with verball prayer, but (as Saint Paule ſayeth) to pray with <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> mouth and minde togither, hauing receyued at Gods hands both the one and the other. How be it let vs chiefly pray with ſpirit: for (as our ſauiour ſaid <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> to the Samaritan) God is ſpirit, &amp; thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150504:26"/> which worſhip him, muſt in ſpirit and <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> trueth, worſhip him. Wherevppon we knowe right well, that the holy Saints of olde time, did exerciſe themſelues moſt chieflie, and commonly in this kinde of prayer, as hauing by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence prooued, howe much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and ſpirituall comfort, the ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth by this ſpirituall prayer, then by that of the mouth. This thing alſo alone declareth ſufficiently of what importaunce they deemed this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and howe neceſſarie for all good Chriſtians, in that they are not afray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call the ſame omnipotent: for ſo much as beeing made as it ought to bee, wee thereby obtaine euerye thing, like as Chriſt our Redeemer hath promiſed, ſaying: Verylie I ſaie vnto you, that whatſoeuer that you <note place="margin">Mat. 21. Mar. 11. Iohn 15.</note> ſhall aske by prayer, beleeue it ſhall be giuen you.</p>
            <p>This prayer wherof we now ſpeake, is a lifting vp of our minde to GOD, which is rather doone with inflamed deſires of the heart, then with varietie
<pb facs="tcp:150504:27"/> of outward wordes, and ſo are we leſſe pained therein then in the other: yea, looke howe much the longer we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this kinde of exerciſe, and ſo much doe wee finde it the more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie and fruitfull for our ſoule, for that each time a man frequenteth this holie exerciſe, hee ſtill ſucketh out newe ſappe of graces and ſpirituall treaſure: yea, ſuch as at ſome tymes the ſoule dooth (as it were) handle and feele it moſte apparantlie. For like as Moyſes had his face lightened and made glittering, through his often conuerſion with GOD, in ſuch wiſe as the Children of Iſraell (according <note place="margin">Exo 34. 2. Cor. 3.</note> as holie Scripture telleth) coulde not abide to looke vppon him; euen ſo the ſoule through perſeueraunce in prayer, becommeth more lightened, and illuminated with the new graces it receyueth. We know moreouer, how Chriſt our Redeemer (as the holie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt Saint Luke reporteth) bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer, was transfigured, and his <note place="margin">Luke 9. Math. 17. Marke 9. 2. Pet. 1.</note> face viſiblie changed into as beautifull
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150504:27"/> a brightneſſe as the Sunne, his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo became as white as ſnowe; euen ſo is the ſoule of man in prayer transfigured, and chaunged into God, and the darkneſſe thereof turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to light; frailetie into force; feare into hope; ſadneſſe into ſolace, with other innumerable commodities that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie can bee rehearſed, which tryall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth to proceede out of this holie prayer.</p>
            <p>Sithence then this is for all ſo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and neceſſarie an exerciſe, I ſhall ſtretch my ſelfe oute a little the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to tell thee in what maner thou oughteſt to make it.

            <p>Firſt (notwithſtanding) am I to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe thee of certaine pointes, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150504:28"/> muſt needs be thought of before thou enter into this kind of exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Whereof take this for the firſt, that thou force thy ſelfe (being one that haſt leaſure enough) to haue an houre in the morning, and another in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which thou art to allot and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to this ſo profitable an exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Who ſo could not for all that haue ſo much time as he woulde, ought not to giue ouer and neglect this exerciſe: yea, he rather were to take ſuch houres and time for it, as his buſineſſe mighte beſt aforde him.</p>
            <p>Now when thou commeſt to theſe determinate houres, (being ſo thou maieſt haue them in maner aforeſayd) it behoueth thee to prepare thy ſelfe (as the wiſe man ſaith) before praier, to the end thou maiſt haue more attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deuotion and reuerence, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes requiſite, for the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of this exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Thy prepartion therefore let it be in this manner, when thou commeſt to the time and place perfixed: indeuour
<pb facs="tcp:150504:29"/> thy ſelfe to lay aſide all other cares and cogitations, which in any wiſe may im peach thee, weighing well the weight and ſeriouſneſſe of this affaire thou art in hande withall. And to the ende thou maieſt haue the more attention and reuerence, conſider howe when thou art in praier, thou ſpeakeſt not to the wind, nor to the walles: but ſtandeſt moſt aſſuredly before the face of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, and that God is there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at thy praiers, liſtning thy wordes, vewing thy teares, and taking delight in thy deuotion and holy exerciſe. For albeit he vniuerſally asſiſt all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet asſiſteth hee chiefely ſuch as praie to him, according as the ſacred ſcripture witneſſeth, ſaying: <hi>There is no</hi>

This conſideration ſhall make thee humble thy ſelfe, and bowe downe to the verie duſt of the earth, and ſtand with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling before that ſacred ſoueraigntie and dreadfull maieſtie.</p>
            <p>With this thought maieſt thou kneele downe in reuerent wiſe, ſaying the Lordes prayer, crauing of GOD briefly forgiueneſſe of thy ſinnes, but thoſe eſpecially wherein thou haſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that day; as alſo grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this affaire better then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to ſpend that ſmal time to his glorie &amp; the profit of thine own ſoule, ſithence wee are not able without his grace to doe anie good thing.

            <p>Thirdly, thou muſt vnderſtand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the foreſaid meditations, that if at any time it ſo happened, that in
<pb facs="tcp:150504:46"/> ſuch points as be ſet down to meditate vpon, thou happely foundſt in the firſt or ſecond of them good deuotion: therein maieſt thou ſtay ſo long as thy deuotion ſhall laſte: not coueting to paſſe ouer to the other points remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning behinde in that meditation, for if thou chaunce to leaue ſome vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for that time, thou maiſt another daye ſupplie that want. In like manner mean I, if through any vrgent affaires thou ſhouldſt ſometime omit thine ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>erciſe, or appointed hower, that then thou force thy ſelfe to ſupply that want with a new houre, &amp; if not on the ſame yet on ſome other daie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, thou muſt procure by all <note place="margin">Deuotiou to be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</note> meanes, to cheriſh and intertaine thy deuotion and godly purpoſes, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good guiftes (whatſoeuer) thou mighteſt happely haue receaued in time of praier: and this ſhalt thou doo by indeuoring thee to goe, as retyred and gathered in the daye time as thou maiſt, calling to mind eftſoones what thou erſt did meditate and receaue, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150504:46"/> when thou heareſt the clocke ſtrike or otherwiſe as thou maiſt.</p>
            <p>Now if on the otherſide it ſo chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <note place="margin">A docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthy great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</note> thou wert diſquieted with diuerſe forraine thoughts (as it eftſoones hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth) and thereby ſhoulde remaine without any deuotion or taſte in thy praier: yet oughteſt thou not for al this to giue ouer thine exerciſe, vntill thy time bee fully finiſhed, ſithens many times, yea moſt commonly it falleth ſo out, that one findeth himſelfe colde, and without taſte or tallage in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, &amp; afterwards (through perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in his praier) gathereth heate, and findeth good deuotion, yea when it ſo chaunced, that thou ſhouldſt not finde any taſte or ſauour at all, in the whole time of all thy prayer: neither yet ought this to diſmay or make thee quaile, but rather beleeue aſſuredly, that ſuch is the Lord his good pleaſure at that time thereby to try, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thy patience, thy loyalty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeueraunce, like as hee dealt with the woman of Canaan, whome albeit hee <note place="margin">Mat. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And beleeue this aſſuredly, that how much the more thou ſhalt perſeuer in this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150504:47"/> exerciſe: ſo much the more profit and pleaſure ſhalt thou finde thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other maruellous gifts which are not knowne, nor perceiued at the firſt.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, for that by reaſon of this deſire, (being common and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to each one, to couet and taſt ſome deuotion in their prayers:) diuers are wont in ſeeking by force and violence to wreſt it out, and do therein greatly amiſſe, as by that meanes oppresſing their vnderſtanding, and dulling their affect and will.</p>
            <p>Fiftlly, it is meete to aduertiſe thee heerein, that in the paſſages of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or any ſuch other holy examples, thou ſhalt meditate vpon; thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thee with a ſimple and quiet ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, of ſuch points as thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt on, and with that affection &amp; taſt God ſhall vouchſafe to beſtowe vpon thee, without forcing thine vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Violence in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly hurtful.</note> or imagination, to ſpeculate and imagine things more plainely, ne yet thy will to feele and taſt the ſame: by wringing out affections and tears with
<pb facs="tcp:150504:48"/> violence: for theſe immoderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes both on the one ſide, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on the other, are woont rather to hinder then helpe deuotion: hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the hed with that inordinat toile: And when the violence of this part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue is once paſt; the will dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine then more colde and without taſte. Make thy Meditation therefore with quietneſſe and peace, waiting with patient ſilence, what our Lorde ſhall worke in thee: and holding thy ſelfe contented therewith as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide.</p>
            <p>Finallye (to aduertiſe thee in euerie thing) knowe this by the way: that if thou finde paine and diſquientneſſe in kneeling (for ſo muſt thou needes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thy ſelfe in the beginning) then mayeſt thou riſe vp and ſtande, ſitte, or walke: as thou thinkeſt moſt meet, for obtaining that quietneſſe and reſt thou deſireſt in thy ſoule.</p>

               <p>Secondly, thinke how greatly this Lord thy God deteſteth ſinne; ſeeing he hath ſo rigorouſlie puniſhed it from the beginning of the World, with the waters of that vniuerſal floud, with fire from heauen, wherewith he puniſhed <note place="margin">Gen. 7</note>

Now the ſoule, it ſhall bee preſented before Chriſt the dreadfull Iudge, to whom it ſhal yeeld a moſt ſtrict and narrow reckoning of all her life, and ſhall receiue as ſhe hath don in the body, an euerlaſting doom: weigh well heere what the ſoule ſhall feele, whiles it waiteth for this doome, not wotting on which ſide it ſhall bee ſent.</p>

               <p>Firſt, howe terrible and dreadfull a day that ſhalbe, aſwell by reaſon of the ſignes and wonders that ſhal go before it, in the Sunne, Moone, the ſea, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, with the ruine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of the whole world: as alſo

               <p>Secondly, conſider the brightneſſe and beautie which the elect ſhall riſe <note place="margin">2.

               <p>Thirdly, think how highly the good ſhall bee fauoured and honoured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that vniuerſall aſſemblie, and what the reprobate ſhall feele, ſeeing Chriſt in ſuch power and maieſtie, and <note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> with that finall doome, throwe them downe to eucrlaſting torments.</p>

And that thou mayeſt the better ſo doo, conſider theſe pointes following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the terrible tormentes which <note place="margin">Apoc. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> the wicked ſhall ſuffer in that place of horror, amongſt all the deuils, which, ſurpaſſe all other paines and torments that in this world may be poſſibly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: and after the reſurrection, ſhal they both in body and ſoule, in all their powers, parts, and ſences, ſuffer more pangs and paines, then the tongue of man may any way expreſſe. For like as the wicked haue offended God, with all their partes, powers, and ſences, and haue imployed them all, as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſerue ſinne with; euen ſo ſhall Gods diuine iuſtice ordaine, that in all the ſelfe ſame parts, powers, &amp; ſences,
<pb facs="tcp:150504:56"/> they ſhall ſuffer ſorrowe and torment, that ſo, may that which is written bee fulfilled: <hi>How much he glorified himſelf,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 18</note> 
                  <hi>and was in delicacies, giue him ſo much torments and lamentations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly thinke, how beſides theſe ſenſible tormentes, they are to ſuffer that which ſhal moſt of all afflict them and cauſe an exceſſiue ſorrowe, which is, a deſpaire they ſhall haue, wotting well, that in al eternity they ſhall neuer ſee God. And as they ſhal alwaies cal to mind the infinit good they loſt, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their frantike folly, and knowe there is no remedy now to recouer it: this ſhal plunge them into a pit of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable torments, making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rage, and raue againſt God himſelfe, &amp; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other creature euerlaſtinglie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider the eternitie of thoſe pains, which if a man could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly ponder, there is no one thing that appaleth or frighteth more; ſith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked ſhall continue in theſe torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts more years, then there be drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſea, or ſeeds of ſand on earth,

And finallie, theſe their tormentes ſhall neuer, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, haue any one moment of releaſe, or minute of relaxation. Hence may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <note place="margin">A notable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</note> thou gather this fruitfull note, that if ſo thou wert now in thoſe torments, which eftſoones thorough thy ſinnes thou haſt deſerued, what wouldſt thou doo to come out of them? Thinke howe any other paine whatſoeuer woulde ſeeme pleaſaunt to thee, and what torment ſo euer were enioyned thee, thou wouldeſt right willinglie performe: doo therefore ſomewhat nowe of that thou wouldeſt then doe, to eſcape theſe ſo great tormentes and perpetuall calamities.</p>

               <p>Secondlie ponder, what a comfort and ſweet delight it ſhall bee, to bee in that bleſſed ſociety of ſo many angels, Saints, Apoſtles &amp; martyrs, al of them beeing ſo bright and beautifull, what ſhall it be to ſee the ſacred humanity of Chriſt, and how ſhal one bee rauiſhed with the hearing of the ſweete harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and melodious muſicke that ſhall be there, and to enioy ſo ſweet a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation euerlaſtingly?</p>
               <p>Thirdly conſider howe yet beſides theſe, there ſhall bee another glory much more excellent, and ſurpaſsing al humane capacitie, which ſhalbe to

Finallie, thinke there ſhal bee the ful accompliſhment and heape of al goodneſſe, without intermedling of any euil, as in Hel ſhal al euil be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture of anye goodneſſe. The Prophet Ieremie ſayth, how on a time <note place="margin">Ierem. 24</note> he ſawe at the Temple gates, two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyers of Figges, the one of good figs and ſingular good, the other ſo naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they coulde not bee eaten, ſo naughtie were they.

            <p>The ſecond part of Chriſt his life,

Thou oughteſt therefore to take heede of diſtracting thy minde in diuers vaine thoughts, of ſpending thy time in prophane and vnprofitable conuerſations, of diſordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of exceſsiue paſſions of thy ſoule, as ange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe and ſuch other like imperfections, whereby the peace and ſercuitie of thy ſoule may bee ſhadowed and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, are in any wiſe (ſo much as may be) to be auoided.

But if ſo bee thou want skill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy ſelfe, to cull and gather them out, then maieſt thou frame wordes of thine owne, (according as the holie Ghoſt ſhall vouchſafe to inſtruct and teach thee) ſuch as may ſerue moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for thy purpoſe, and cauſe thy zeale to encreaſe to God-ward, and to good deſires. And albeit, at the firſt it maie ſeeme, thou darteſt not thoſe amorous arrowes with any great feruor or fierie heate of ſoule, yet faile not to ſpend and breath them foorth, for no doubt but they ſhal afterwards kindle, and gather heart, and helpe thee greatly to warme thy ſoule withall. But if happily thou couldeſt not light on ſuch wordes as
<pb facs="tcp:150504:66"/> thou wiſheſt for, ſend then vp certaine ſighes and grones, drawne out from the bottom of thy heart, and theſe ſhal ſupplie and ſerue in ſtead of wordes to God-ward, who wel wotteth what thy ſpirit doth craue and long for.</p>
            <p>Theſe darting praiers, with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, ſighes, and ſpeeches aboueſaid, ſhall likewiſe helpe ſuch greatly as lack conuenient leyſure to perfourme this exerciſe, in ſuch maner as I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore declared.</p>
            <p>The fourth remedie which may be vſed, <note place="margin">The 4. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reading of ſome god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bookes.</note> at ſuch time as thy diſtraction were greater then that the former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes could ſuffize to call thy minde home, and to cauſe attencion: then mayeſt thou haue recourſe to reading, whereto ſhall be verie expedient thou be prouided of ſome godly booke, full of good deuotion and ſound doctrine, and theron to read with leiſure, fair and ſoftly; not lightly running ouer manie leaues, but pawſing at euery period &amp; ſentence, to chaw the ſame, &amp; to picke thence ſom profit &amp; fruitful deuotion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150504:66"/> ſtaying therin ſo long as attention ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thee, which once wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, proceed then on forward to another ſentence, doing likewiſe in that: and thus migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou by meanes of ſuch wordes as thou readeſt, vſe thoſe ſpeaches, ſighs, and inflamed deſires, whereof I laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpake in the thirde remedie, ſith no doubt but they are very vailable, and of great force to retire thy minde home, and to kindle in it a deuotion and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent loue to Godward. The fitſt books for this purpoſe, are ſuch as ſtirre vp a man to pietie and deuotion, and that withall giue good inſtructions for life and maners, the books of Iob, Pſalms, the Prouerbes, Preacher, the Epiſtles of Saint Paule, &amp;c. In theſe and ſuch like bookes maiſt thou occupy thy ſelf, now reading, now meditating on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and alwaies committing ſome ſpiritual point to memorie, which thy ſoul may (amongſt other thy buſines) nouriſh and comfort it ſelfe withall.</p>
            <p>The laſt remedie thou art to take concerning this matter, is to force
<pb facs="tcp:150504:67"/> thy ſelfe to perſeuer in praier, howe diſtract and frozen ſoeuer thou ſhalt <note place="margin">The fift remedie againſt di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtraction is perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance.</note> finde thee, for that who ſo ſhall thus force and ſtraine himſelf to endure the tedious toile, and pain of praier: whiles thus he feeleth himſelf frozen, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with diuers forrein thoughts and fancies, well may he beleeue, that at the end of his praier he ſhall (for the moſt part) receiue comfort &amp; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and that as it happened to our Sauiour, whom the angell came and comforted in the garden, after his long perſeuerance in praier, which he made three ſeuerall times, euen ſo ſhal it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the end befall to him. And as in other workes experience teacheth vs, that cuſtome taketh away the toyle which we feele at the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, euen ſo ſhall cuſtome and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this exerciſe (not ſlacking or neglecting it at any time) cut off the toile and trauaile thereof, and cauſe a conqueſt of all ſuch difficulties, as in the beginning ſeemeth right painfull to vs.</p>

For the ſpeech of a man, is the trueſt witneſſe of his heart; for as our Sauiour ſayth, The mouth ſpeaketh <note place="margin">Luk. 6.</note> of the aboundance of the hart: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he which ſpeaketh euill bee not

Filthy ſpeech is a ſigne of an vnchaſt heart, although no outward work do follow. Therfore a chriſtian man, which in his baptiſme hath promiſed to forſake the Deuill and al his workes, and conſequentlie thoſe that bee his members, muſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the company of wicked men, and euermore auoid them that ſpeak wickedneſſe, and vncleanneſſe. We muſt euer remember the ſaying of the Wiſe man: Hee that toucheth pitch defileth his fingers, and he that kepeth company with the proud, ſhal put on pride. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayeth, Thoſe that bee weak muſt eſchew euil company, leaſt the faults which they daily ſee, and bee not able to amend, become pleaſaunt vnto them. And S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> If a good man company with a wicked man, either they become equal, or elſe the one is quickly ſeparated from the

For ſo is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of things, that as often as a good man is ioyned with a bad man, the good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not made the better for it, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defiled ther by: for contrary things can neuer haue concorde: and wicked company hath allured many. As one diſeaſed ſheep infecteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole flock, ſo one peruerſe and wicked chriſtian, is cauſe of a great number of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the church. For S.

They ſhal be hated of their kinsfolke and neighbours, and no faithfull friend ſhall know them: they leade their life in hypocritical diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and by their fooliſhneſſe they draw many out of the way; They hate peace, they loue diſcord, they ſhall bee taken in the ſluggiſhnes of their mind, and none ſhall haue compaſſion vpon them.</p>

Let not a detractor bee in thy companie, becauſe he is far worſe than a theefe. Him that is light-minded &amp; diſſolute in maners, account as a man that teareth hedges in the fielde. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide a drunken man as the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of letchery, and the ſinke of all ſin. He that truſteth to the deuiſe of his owne head, is neere vnto deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and aſpireth ſpeedily vnto the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his owne ſoule.

            <p>The friendſhip of a good man hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the ſoule, but the company of the wicked, corrupteth the innocencie of ſimple men.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150504:80"/> againſt ſin.

            <p>Firſt conſider how God doth looke vpon thee and his Angells beholdeth all thine actions, that by this meanes thou be aſhamed to parpetrate ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt an act, in their celeſtiall ſight, and preſence, ſith before any neuer ſo ſimple a man, thou wouldſt not bee ſo impudent, and ſhameleſſe as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly conſider howe this vice, moſt notoriouſly polluteth, thy fleſh it ſelfe, and all thy members (which whiles thou perſeuereſt in grace, are the temple of the holy ghoſt) become now throgh his ſin the members of an harlot, as S.

            <p>Fourthly conſider, that albeit thou wouldeſt neuer ſo faine wallow ſtill in this peſtiferous puddle of ſin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire neuer ſo greatlie to ſaciate this corrupt deſire of thine, yet ſhall it bee impoſſible ſo to doe, this being one of the things that is neuer ſaciated.

            <p>The fift and laſt kind of gluttony, is <note place="margin">The fift kind of gluttony.</note> an exceſſiue care and thought, to ſeeke
<pb facs="tcp:150504:84"/> out diuerſitie of cates, and new fangled taſtes; which thou oughtſt (as a blame <note place="margin">A curious deſire of ſtrange taſtes.</note> worthy thing) greatly to eſchewe and beware of, for feare of beeing like to thoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, that <note place="margin">Phi. 3.

For reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie both of theſe and all other kindes of gluttonie, theſe conſiderations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhall greatly helpe, which thou mayſt take for a ſecond remedy.</p>
            <p>Firſt conſider, how much the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging <note place="margin">The 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</note> &amp; heauines of thy ſtomach, or that remaineth therein (hauing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſurfetted) doth more hurt and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee; then the diuerſity of delicate and ſweet meats can delight and doo thee good: the taſt and pleaſure wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of laſteth no longer, then whiles the meate is paſſing from the mouth to <note place="margin">Taſt, how ſmally it tarrieth.</note> the throte, neither after it is once gone is there any memoryial or ſigne of this delight remaining.</p>
            <p>This mayeſt thou much better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150504:84"/> if thou examine what nowe reſteth, of al that euer thou haſt ſwallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and ſwilled al thy whole life time. <note place="margin">Note wel.</note> What haſt thou now left of all thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts, and all thy ſweet taſtes, of all the dainty morſels that euer thou deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt? what haſt thou now extant forth comming of al this? thou ſeeſt, how al is quite vaniſhed away, as though ther had neuer bin any ſuch: make account therefore, when thou feeleſt thy ſelfe tempted with this vice, that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is already gone, which ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dooth paſſe away. And care not for condiſcending to thy fleſh, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it thus diſordinately may couet an deſire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider the inconueni <note place="margin">The 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. <hi>Amb. lib. de Helia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <pb facs="tcp:150504:85"/> ſhall bee in the next worlde; where no one drop of water ſhalbe graunted, as we gather plainely by that example of the rich glutton.

            <p>The third remedie, is to thinke on <note place="margin">The third remedy. Mat. 12. Mar. 2.

            <p>The fourth remedie, is eftſoones to <note place="margin">The 4. remedy. Mat. 22. Luke. 14. Apoc. 19.

            <p>The laſt remedie, and that a verie <note place="margin">The fift remedy.</note> ſecure one, is, ſo much as thou maieſt poſſiblie, to fly all occaſions of glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; <note place="margin">Occaſions to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed.</note> as the feaſtes and iunkettinges of worldly men, where there is ſo great abundance and variety of viandes, ſo many meates, drinks, delicate &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruites, amidſt the which may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly any manne keepe ſobrietie, there being ſo many thinges to allure him to gluttonie.

Now if theſe men, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely by the light of nature, made choice of pouertie, hauing meanes to be rich; why ſhouldſt not thou (being illuminated with a higher light) and more glittering brightneſſe of heauen lie grace, welwot the ſame truth, and make a vertue of neceſſitie, contenting thee with that pouerty, that god of his <note place="margin">To make of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty vertue.</note> great good prouidence hath giuen thee, as a verie ſubſtantiall and ſecure meane of ſaluation?

Remember howe Gehezi, the Prophet Elizeus ſeruaunt, beeing not contented with his calling, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to bee rich, deſerued (with his riches) to haue a perpetual leaproſie laide vpon him. We read likwiſe, how Ananias and Zaphira, through a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe they had to retaine ſome <note place="margin">Actes. 5 Ananias &amp; zaphira</note> part of the goodes, which they hadde earſt begunne to renounce; were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their corporal liues. Thou canſt not be ignorant, into what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable blindeneſſe, this couetouſneſſe brought that accurſed Iudas, as the <note place="margin">Iudas.</note> ſcripture doth teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Both of theſe, and many more ſuch <note place="margin">Matth. 26 Luke. 22 Mark. 18</note> examples, if thou conſider well: thou ſhalt thereby diſcerne, howe much more ſecure the poore mans eſtate is, being contented with his pouerty: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of the rich man, beeing neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with al his plenty.</p>
            <p>Thou oughteſt not therfore, thus
<pb facs="tcp:150504:92"/> greedily to long for wealth &amp; worldlie ſubſtance, which may cauſe thee fall into ſo many daungerous and perilous temptations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider the perils and difficulties, aſwell of the bodies, as <note place="margin">Couetous men fall into the Deuils ſnares.</note> ſoules of the rich men, &amp; ſuch as with ſo great anxiety do ſeeke after worldlie wealth; ſith by this their longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after riches, they fal into the deuils ſnares, (as Paule ſaith) Thou ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly conſider, how by louing of pouerty, and willingly embracing it: thou art by that means more rich and noble, then all the rich Gentlemenne

What greater honour, or degree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt thou, then to be of the ſame ſtate and condition, as ſo high a Lorde was of? yea, thou art (withall) moſt rich, for thus is the kingdome of heauen, and the king and Lorde thereof, thine: and ſo by poſſeſſing of him, thou poſſeſſeſt all riches, and much more precious treaſures, then may bee in this life ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attained, imagined or deſired.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, another good remedie, <note place="margin">Couetous mens com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany to be auoided.</note> not to fall into the temptation of aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, is to ſhunne (as much as may be) the haunting of rich mens companie, eſpecially if they be couetous, leaſt (by their conſideration) thou beeſt ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with their infection. Take heed in like maner, not to ſee or deale with much money, riches, or any beautifull
<pb facs="tcp:150504:93"/> or pretious thinges of this world, the ſight whereof doth commonly kindle our hearts, to deſire and long for them where otherwiſe, by not ſeeing them, thou ſhouldſt want this greedy deſire of hauing them. Fly therfore (as much as thou maieſt) to touch or to deale with mony, which is like to pitch (as is teſtified in the Scripture) defileth ſuch <note place="margin">Eccle. 13.</note> as touch it; it ſhall help thee alſo not a little in this matter, to goe ſometimes <note place="margin">Mony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſileth like pitch.</note> and viſit hoſpitalls, and to conuerſe with poore folkes; weighing alſo, how others that be poorer then thou arte, beare patiently their wants &amp; penury.</p>
            <p>All theſe remedies may (in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) ſerue to helpe the rich, albeit in very deed, there be others, that might (by the conſiderations following) be more fitte for their purpoſe, to make them withdraw their mindes from ſo greatly ſancying of worldely wealth. <note place="margin">The third remedy againſt couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> Firſt conſider if thou be rich, this will helpe thee much, for this is the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; be not ouerwhelmed with aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, for that is, to force thee (ſeeme it

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Iuers of the remedies, that haue beene preſcribed thee againſt pride, may in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner helpe thee againſt this ſin of wrath and anger, ſeeing that moſt commonly ſuch as be proud and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are wont alſo to be angry and yre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; yet neuertheleſſe bee there other <note place="margin">The proud ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ireful.</note> peculiar remedies to bee vſed againſt this vice.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, to ponder, how farre it is <note place="margin">The firſt remedy againſt anger.</note> out of all good frame and reaſon, that any man ſhould be angry, and deſire to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150504:98"/> hurt another: ſith if brute beaſtes, bee they neuer ſo fell, fight not one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <note place="margin">The vnity of brute beaſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malice of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind</note> but liue in peace and vnitie with thoſe of their owne kinde; howe much more reaſon is it, that men ſhuld doe the like, who are not borne armed as brutiſh and ſauage beaſtes bee, nor prouided of weapons to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or to offend others?</p>
            <p>Secondly, behold the vglineſſe and <note place="margin">The 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie againſt anger.</note> deformity of an angry man, both in his countenance, geſture, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: in all the which thou ſhalt at that time ſee him wonderfully diſordered, and beſides himſelfe: ſee thou beware therefore of beeing angry, if thou wilt <note place="margin">An angry man be ſide him ſelfe.</note> not fall into thoſe defectes, which in others doo ſo greatly diſlike thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie conſider, that whoſoeuer, he bee that hath proffered thee any <note place="margin">The third remedie againſt anger.</note> wrong or iniury, hath doone himſelfe much more harme then thee: and if thou growe angrie thereat, and ſeeke reuenge, in ſo dooing thou ſhalt hurt thy ſelfe, much more then thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, for that as Chryſoſtom ſaith,
<pb facs="tcp:150504:99"/> 
               <hi>No man is hurt but by himſelfe.</hi> Which ſhould be no leſſe a folly, then for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <note place="margin">Mark wel.</note> to kill himſelfe, to teare his enemyes cote; ſithence thine enimies body is as his coate, which thou meaning to teare, in ſeeking to kill him, dooſt firſt kill and ſlaie thine owne ſoule. For as ſaint Auguſtine ſayeth: <hi>The knife</hi> 
               <note place="margin">S. Auguſt.</note> 
               <hi>pierceth the heart of the perſecutor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the body of the perſecuted.</hi> Striue therefore to maiſter thy ſelfe, and to vanquiſh thine yre, and ſo ſhalt thou gaine greater honour and victorie; then if thou hadeſt ſubdued a mightie Citty, and by this meanes, in not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy ſelfe to take reuenge, God ſhall take it for thee, as he himſelf hath promiſed thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if the deuill (to ſtir thee vp <note place="margin">Deut. 32 Eccleſ. 28 Rom. 12 Heb 9. The 4. remedie againſt anger.</note> to wrath) doo agrauate thine iniury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and make it greater: doe thou (contrariwiſe) what thou canſt to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen it, and to make it ſmaller: thinking thus, how he that in this manner hath iniured thee, is at that time ouercome with ſome paſſion, or indiſcretion, or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150504:99"/> elſe call to mind ſome good turnes he hath earſt done thee, or how thou haſt otherwiſe doone him the like iniurie, or ſome other, which he then did tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate at thy hands, and therefore is it meet, thou beare likewiſe with him. If thou canſt not withhold, call to mind, howe God hath forgiuen thee manye thouſandes, and borne them all at thy handes: for his ſake forget ſuch kinde of ſuddain iniury, and let him be a iuſt recompence for al.</p>
            <p>Fiftly conſider, that ſuch like croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">The fift re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>medy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger.</note> are ſent from aboue, as ſcourges for thy ſins. Take nowe his chaſticement on earth, leaſt the laſt comming paie for al. Beleeue then, that by the bearing patiently of all villanies and iniuries that ſhall bee ſaid and doone agaynſte thee, it wil (by the Almighty) bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and turned to thy exceeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and comfort of thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, if thou feele thy ſelf ouercome <note place="margin">The 6 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt anger.</note> with anger, take heed then thou ſpeak nor do any thing, whereby this ſudden
<pb facs="tcp:150504:100"/> indignation bring further ſinne vppon thee, then thou wouldeſt after wiſh it had nere beene done. For the Diuell, who eggeth thee thereto, ſtandes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to betray thee to vtter darkeneſſe, and bring thy ſoule to confuſion: then pacifie thy ſelfe, and meditate on him that will bee auenged, referring all to his will; then thinke Sathan baniſhed, by mightie and inuincible conqueſt of patience and praier.</p>
            <p>And beware the ſunne neuer goe downe vppon thine anger, according as ſaint Paule admoniſheth: that is to <note place="margin">Ephe, 4</note> ſaie, that thou expell it quicklie, and <note place="margin">

The like patience and mildeneſſe, maieſt thou note in that <note place="margin">2, Reg. 16.</note> holy Kinge Dauid, amongeſt all the manifolde perſecutions and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hee ſuffered, through the whole courſe and period of his life, the which may enforce thee to endure all things very patiently.</p>

It ſuffereth likewiſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from temporall thinges, which it leaueth heere behinde: and look how much they were in life time loued of it, and ſo much more doo they in that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150504:115"/> houre of death torment it. It ſuffereth through the great dread it hath of the ſtrict accoumpt, which it knoweth wel muſt forthwith be paſſed to the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudge, of euery thing it hath doon in all hir life time. It ſuffereth through the horrible viſions of Deuils, which in that houre appeere; the ſight wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is an intollerable torment. And much more doth it ſuffer, through the greeuous and bitter aſſaults, wherwith in that houre, they farre more ſiercelie ſet vpon it, then euer they did before. For like as towardes the ende of the world, and time of general iudgement, the prince of darkeneſſe, ſhal moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riblie, and with greater rage and fury, aſſault mankinde, as he knoweth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how ſmal a time is then remaining for him to doo the ſame, and to infeſt it any longer. In like manner doo the deuils behaue themſelues, towardes ſuch, as be at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point of death, againſte whom they bend all their might and maine, all their ſleightes and ſubtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:150504:116"/> whatſoeuer; ſith they know well, that if the ſoule, in that laſt houre, doe eſcape their dreadfull clookes, they looſe what they pretended to gaine all her life time, in this world. For ſo doe the Doctors commonly ſaie, vpon the ſentence of the Apocalypſe. That <note place="margin">Apoc. 2</note> the diuell deſcendeth with great rage, wotting well that hee hath but a ſmall time lefte. So that the anxietie and bitterneſſe of that houre, ſhalbe great, and no man by wordes ſhall exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it is good to remember that houre before, and arme our ſelues to prepare vs to a ioiful meeting of our redeemer, at this ſo perillous a ſeaſon. And although we perſwad our ſelues, ſo louing a God will not permit vs to bee tempted at ſuch time, aboue our ſtrength; yet muſt we buſie our ſelues in the defending of ſuch batteryes as the enemye will otherwiſe prefixe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs: that being auoyded, then the more happy and bleſſed ſhall wee bee, in the eies of the omnipotent, for that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150504:116"/> Sathan is buſie to ouerthrow vs. Mark then the manner of his temptations, and the ſure defenſes for the ſame, that ſo thou mayeſt the more ſecurely eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape ſo great a perill, and gaine the Crowne prepared for the valiant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</p>
            <p>The firſt, as S. Ambroſe teſtifieth, is <note place="margin">The firſt tentation. Ambroſe.</note> the deuils very drift, to take vs in ſome error of our beleefe, to which tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou canſt not reſiſt better, than as I told thee before in the 26. chapt. <note place="margin">The deuil is to bee deſpiſed.</note> to wit, by deſpiſing and ſcorning, both the anſwer to him, &amp; it. But if of force thou muſt anſwer ſomthing; let it bee this. I beleeue firmly, what God in his word hath taught me to beleeue, and that which the holye Apoſtles haue beleeued and taught, whoſe faith and doctrine almightye GOD, (whome none can deceaue) hath confirmed with innumerable myracles, and for the confeſſion whereof hath ſo much bloud of Martyrs beene ſpilt. Sticke faſte vnto this aunſwere, and care
<pb facs="tcp:150504:117"/> not to his other obiections, or to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere them. Thus then behauing thy ſelfe, no doubt but thou ſhalt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſuggeſtion, is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: <note place="margin">Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the 2. tentation.</note> perſwading at that houre, ſome indecent thing of our bleſſed Sauiour. Heereto mayeſt thou reſiſt, by retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this aunſwere to the deuill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that propoundeth it, in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>I am more than aſſured, that my Lord God is infinitely good, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all ſouereigne praiſe, and loue, <note place="margin">A retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the feends ſuggeſtion</note> and that all his holy ſaints are moſt per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect, and repleniſhed with al vertue, &amp; therefore thou art moſt abhominable, and for theſe blaſphemies to bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſpiſed and abhorred. Then turning to thy maker, giuing all praiſe and glory, with humble bleſſinges of his holy name. So ſhalt thou caſt and ſhake off the deuill.</p>
            <p>The third temptation, is deſpaire of <note place="margin">The third tentation.</note> forgiueneſſe of thy ſinnes, which is moſt greeuous at that time to vs, by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:150504:117"/> conſidering diuine iuſtice, whereto it belongeth, not to ſuffer any one ſinne vnpuniſhed: and then his perſwaſions is, to make thee thinke, that all in vain is repentance at that houre.</p>
            <p>The remedie for this, is to humble thy ſelfe in the ſight of God, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate <note place="margin">The reme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt deſpaire.</note> his diuine Clemencie, calling to mind his paſſion, whoſe moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and bitter woundes, thou muſt offer vppe to his father, for all thy ſins and tranſgreſſions whatſoeuer: ſaying as followeth.</p>

And if at any time it ſo chanced, aſwell it may do eftſoones by reaſon of lets and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, thou ſhouldeſt be for ſome time forced to intermitte thine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and wonted exerciſes, be not any deale diſmaide therewith, but when this time of trouble is once ouer ſhot, renewe againe thy courſe and followe <note place="margin">Mark. 13.

            <p>Forſomuch as the thinges that are here in treated of, ſith they be the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and remembrances, which thou oughteſt in ſpirituall life, to leuell and guide thy works by, it behooueth at all times to reade them, when thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſt to practiſe them.

Seeing that euery artiſan thinks it meete to knowe ſuch things as belonge vnto his art, howe much more is a true Chriſtian bound for to know, what appertaineth to his profeſſion?
